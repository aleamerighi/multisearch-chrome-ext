# PZL! Social MultiSearch

Look up content simultaneously on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.

## How to use

I developed this Google Chrome extension as a simple search engine to explore content on multiple social media. By using this tool, users can query up to four social networks at the same time and on a single click. You just type a search and select which services to filter from among Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.

### Prerequisites

There are no special prerequisites for using this tool, except you have to run it on a Google Chrome browser.

### Installing

Go to the Chrome Webstore(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and type 'PZL! Social MultiSearch' in the search bar. Then, click on 'Add to Chrome' to get the extension running in your browser (icon should appear in the upper right corner of the Google Chrome menu.
